# AboutMe

**I build this project to introduce myself and give more information about me.
I want from visitor to my page to guess the answers for five "yes/no" questions,after that he will find
two guessing questions with limited attempts.
Visitor will see the score for right answers with welcoming message, then get access my information page.**
